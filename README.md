## Key Features:
- Demonstrates all basic comparison operators
- Uses conditional statements to compare different values
- Displays the results of comparisons for integers, floating-point numbers, and strings

## Usage:
Run the main class to see examples of how comparison operators work in Java. You can modify the input values to test different comparison scenarios.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
